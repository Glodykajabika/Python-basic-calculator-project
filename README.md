# Python-basic-calculator-project


A clean, beginner-friendly **console-based calculator** built with Python. This project performs basic arithmetic operations — addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division — while handling common errors gracefully.

Perfect for learning core Python concepts like user input, conditionals, loops, type conversion, and basic error handling.

## Features

- Add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers  
- Supports both integers and decimal (floating-point) numbers  
- Prevents division by zero with a friendly error message  
- Handles invalid inputs (e.g., letters instead of numbers)  
- Option to perform multiple calculations in one session  

## Concepts Practiced

- `input()` and `print()`
- Type conversion (`int()`)
- Conditional statements (`if-elif-else`)
- Loops (`while`)
- Error handling (`try-except`, `ValueError`, `ZeroDivisionError`)
- f-strings and output formatting
- Basic program flow and user experience

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed
2. Clone or download this repository
3. Open terminal/command prompt in the project folder
4. Run the script:

```bash
python calculator.py
```

(Or whatever you named the file — e.g., `python main.py`)

## Example Usage

```
Enter first number: 15.5
Enter second number: 4
Choose operation (+, -, *, /): /
15.5 / 4 = 3.875

Do you want to calculate again? (y/n): n
Thanks for using the calculator!
```

## Future Improvements (Ideas)

- Add support for more operations (%, **, sqrt)
- Include a calculation history
- Build a GUI version with Tkinter
- Add keyboard shortcuts or menu navigation
